# Assignment 04: Interview in Context
## Amanda Norman, DH 150 Spring 2020
### Introductory Steps:
#### Step 01: Specify the main design challenge.
* ##### What is the main activity your project would support the users in accomplishing?

	My project of redesigning the Los Angeles Department of Public Social Services (DPSS) YourBenefitsNow website aims to support users by streamlining online access to important information about their public social service benefits, such as food stamp amount, case status, benefit applications, etc. In doing so, users’ experience with the service will be efficient, effective, and enjoyable.
	
* ##### What is the basic need involved for that activity? (reference)
	
	This activity satisfies users’ basic physiological needs, including food, water, and health, because it allows them to manage the financial and government resources that assist in making those needs accessible.
 
* ##### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?

	Besides the existing website used to view case details, the traditional solutions to manage access to these needs include contacting the Department of Public Social Services (DPSS) office directly via phone or in-person. 

* ##### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?

	Limitations of traditional solutions of phone or in-person office contact with DPSS include long wait times and inconvenient hours of operation. The ability to access information with digital technology minimizes the inconvenience of these limitations, allowing users to view important information, submit necessary documents, or send a message directly to a caseworker at any time they wish, without spending hours on-hold during a call or in a waiting room at the office.

### Step 02: Target users 
* ##### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise)

  ###### Demographic:
  * low-income individuals and families in Los Angeles
  * low-income university students 
  * People who receive government social service benefits

  ###### Preference:
  * Users who currently receive or are interested in government benefits must  
  ###### Expertise: 
  * Users should have basic computer literacy (i.e. know how to access the internet).
 
* ##### Where would the users do that activity? (i.e., context of use)

  The main activities users would do on this website are checking their benefit amount and case status, submitting any necessary documents required for their case, or applying for benefits. As long as the user has access to the internet, they should be able to view the web browser version of the YourBenefitsNow website. Users are likely to manage their government benefits in their homes where they might have access to a private or personal computer with internet, rather than a public library with computers and internet, as they are dealing with sensitive confidential information. Users might also do this activity using a mobile device with internet, likely in moments where they need to check their food stamp balance, such as in the grocery store.

* ##### What would the users do to complete that activity? (e.g., goal, operation, method, action)
  To submit an application for government benefits or submit required documentation (i.e. income verification, household size, etc), users would either need to visit the DPSS office to collect and submit a physical copy of the application or create an online account on YourBenefitsNow to submit an application and additional required documents.
  For users that already have an active case and want to know details about their case status and benefit amount, they would need to call DPSS customer service and speak to a representative  or create a YourBenefitsNow account and attempt to find the information online.

### Step 03: Pick Observation Method
  I conducted participatory observation research through an interview with a peer who identifies with my target demographic of users. Details of the interview and materials used can be found in the following sections.
