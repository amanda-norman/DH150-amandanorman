# Assignment 05: User Personas + Scenarios
## Amanda Norman, DH 150 Spring 2020
The purpose of UX storytelling is to gain a better understanding of typical, potential users of your product by empathizing with them. I imagined three different personas of users I might expect to use my product, visualizing how they might think, feel, and use the product. I thought of potential frustrations and motivations each user might have to try to gain a different perspective on how my website could be useful. This activity helped me expand my viewpoint outside myself by attempting to identify with the potential use cases of prospective users.    
## Design Features
1. Simplified Navigation Menu (Kara's Scenario)
* reduce the amount of links and information on the main navigation menu of the website to make important functions, like finding benefit amounts, easy to find; makes the interface less cluttered and more minimalistic  
* simplify the language used in the navigation menu to make it as clear and concise as possible; using common terms to speak the user's language

2. "Action Required" Pop-up Notification (Jonathan's Scenario)
* lets users know when a mandatory action is needed for their account as soon as they log-in
* create a streamlined way for users to complete those actions by adding a button that links them straight to the next step

3. Choice of Language Prompt (Brian's Scenario)
* prompts users to choose their language before entering the site
* help non-English speakers feel more comfortable and capable of navigating the website

4. Simplified Online Application Process (Brian's Scenario)
* Create a visible button on the Home Page that leads to the Benefit Application Process
