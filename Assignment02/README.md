# Usability of LADPSS YourBenefitsNow Website
## DH 150 Assignment 2: Pilot Usability Testing by Amanda Norman

### Introduction
The Los Angeles Department of Social Services (DPSS) YourBenefitsNow website is a digital platform that allows people who receive government benefits apply for and view the status of their benefits online. Users can view and manage their government benefits, such as their case status, benefit amount and electronic government notices regarding their case. 

The purpose of usability testing is to assess a website's interface and its usability, highlighting pain points for users. After conducting a heuristic evaluation of the YourBenefitsNow website, common usability issues included:

* No way of returning to the home page with a main menu of options
* The need to completely log in again every time a user clicks the YourBenefitsNow logo
* Lack of site path after navigating to certain pages, making it difficult to trace steps and return directly to a specific page
* Misleading links that direct to completely different webpages, positioned in places where the user would expect something different

I conducted a pilot usability test to evaluate how the design of the YourBenefitsNow website might affect a user's ability to perform basic tasks and functions that the website offers. 

### Methodology
The pilot usability test was conducted in a quiet room in my apartment in Los Angeles. The video was recorded on my personal laptop using the ActivePresenter program. The program recorded the participant's tasks on the website and their facial expression while completing them. It also showed the moderator's reading of the introduction and informed consent policies.  

Prior to beginning the test, the moderator read an introduction to the test, describing the purpose of the usability test and what is expected of the participant. The participant then completed a pre-test questionnaire regarding their prior experience with the website and their initial thoughts. After, the participant completed three tasks on the website while verbalizing their thoughts as they were doing so. First, the participant will be asked to find the current status of their CalFresh case. Next, the participant will be asked to find where they can upload requested documents. Finally, the participant will need to find where they can update their contact information. 

After completing the tasks, the participant took a post-test survey asking about their experience with the website and their feelings of satisfaction with the product including ease of use, efficiency of use, expected frequency of use, learnability, and content organization. Lastly, confidential demographic information was collected about the participant to further inform survey findings.

### Reflection
The pilot usability test helped me gained more insight on usability concerns for the YourBenefitsNow website. While the participant was able to complete all tasks, he expressed frustration in some features of the website's design that made the completing the tasks inefficient, such as the need for the cursor to be hovering directly over the menu to view all choices. He also shared annoyance when trying to return to the website's home page and the need to log in again every time after clicking the YourBenefitsNow logo, thinking it would route him back to the home page. He didn't, however, express the dissatisfaction in the lack of a site path when navigating to various pages, which was a significant finding during the heuristic evaluation. 

Additionally, this pilot test taught me more about the usability testing process in general. Something that went well for me as a moderator was that I was able to restrain myself from helping the participant complete certain tasks he was stuck on, despite feeling the urge to provide a hint. Eventually the participant figured out the task, which helped me realize that not all participants may think to navigate a website as I do and emphasized the importance of user testing. I found that it was not natural for participants to begin verbalizing their thoughts as they are performing actions, unless reminded to do so. For future usability testing, I will try to remind participants to talk aloud right before they begin the tasks so that we can gain more information about the user's thought process when navigating the website and feelings of certain functions as they are in use.
