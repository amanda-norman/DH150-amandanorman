# YourBenefitsNow Website Redesign
## Amanda Norman

### Introduction
There are many public services that are available to Los Angeles residents, but many may not be very accessible due to the usability and functionality of their websites. Because the internet is a powerful, useful, and relevant digital tool for the modern age, I want to explore ways we can make public resources user-friendly and accessible via the internet.

This project is a redesign of the YourBenefitsNow (YBN) website - a self-service portal from the Los Angeles Department of Public Social Services that allows users to view information and complete tasks related to their government benefits. It is an important public service that allows people to view and manage their government benefits, such as their case status, benefit amount and electronic government notices regarding their case.

### Design Statement
Many people's lives depend on government assistance, so the YourBenefitsNow (YBN) website is an essential service to those who need to apply or keep track of their benefits. The current YBN website features People who receive government assistance span a large range of ages, cultural backgrounds, abilities and socio-economic status. Therefore, it is really important that the YBN website is simple to navigate, available in multiple languages, and accessible to most people. 

My project of redesigning the Los Angeles Department of Public Social Services (DPSS) YourBenefitsNow website aims to support users by streamlining online access to important information about their public social service benefits, such as food stamp amount, case status, benefit applications, etc. In doing so, usersâ€™ experience with the service will be efficient, effective, and enjoyable.


### Competitor Analysis
#### Heuristic Evaluation
My initial overall evaluation of this website is that there is a lot of information and a lot of links on every page, which may make navigating the site overwhelming for users. The navigation bar itself, though, does not have many choices, so that may indicate the most important tasks and information that users come to the site for.

#### Usability Testing
The purpose of usability testing is to assess a website's interface and its usability, highlighting pain points for users. After conducting a heuristic evaluation of the YourBenefitsNow website, common usability issues included:

* No way of returning to the home page with a main menu of options
* The need to completely log in again every time a user clicks the YourBenefitsNow logo
* Lack of site path after navigating to certain pages, making it difficult to trace steps and return directly to a specific page
* Misleading links that direct to completely different webpages, positioned in places where the user would expect something different

I conducted a pilot usability test to evaluate how the design of the YourBenefitsNow website might affect a user's ability to perform basic tasks and functions that the website offers. [Read More...](https://github.com/amanda-norman/DH150-amandanorman/tree/master/Assignment02)


### User Research
To better understand users' past experiences and tailor the redesign to users' needs, I conducted contextual inquiry. [Read More...](https://github.com/amanda-norman/DH150-amandanorman/tree/master/Assignment04)

###  UX storytelling 
The purpose of UX storytelling is to gain a better understanding of typical, potential users of your product by empathizing with them. I imagined three different personas of users I might expect to use my product, visualizing how they might think, feel, and use the product. I thought of potential frustrations and motivations each user might have to try to gain a different perspective on how my website could be useful. This activity helped me expand my viewpoint outside myself by attempting to identify with the potential use cases of prospective users.

### Wireframe and graphic design element variation 

#### Low-fidelity prototype 
The purpose of this low-fidelity prototype is to illustrate the re-imagined design of the YBN website that incorporates insights from my user research and improved design features. [Read More...](https://github.com/amanda-norman/DH150-amandanorman/tree/master/Assignment06)



#### High-fidelity prototype 
The purpose of this prototyping stage is to create a high-fidelity mockup of the graphical user interface and the user flow of the product that incorporates improved design features. In creating this prototype, the designer(s) is able to visually construct their idea and create the flow of the product in order to experiment with design features and functionality.

### Evaluation and revision history 

#### Impression Test
I conducted an impression test to gauge whether or not users understood what the website would be used for and to gain insight on initial thoughts of the website.  [Read More...](https://github.com/amanda-norman/DH150-amandanorman/tree/master/Assignment07)
