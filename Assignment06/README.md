# Assignment 06: Low-Fidelity Prototype
## Amanda Norman, DH 150 Spring 2020
### **Description** 
My project is a redesign of the YourBenefitsNow (YBN) website - a self-service portal from the Los Angeles Department of Public Social Services that allows users to view information and complete tasks related to their government benefits. 

#### **Personas**

After conducting user research, I creating the following personas of typical users: 

1. Working college students who need a quick and efficient way to access information about their benefits online
2. Low-income families and parents who have low technical literacy and need an interface that is simple to navigate and streamlines the process of applying for benefits and checking the status of benefits.

#### **Features and Tasks**

Based on my user research and personas, I created several features and potential tasks supported by this low-fidelity prototype that would meet the personas' needs.

***Features***

**1. Choice of Language Prompt**
- prompts users to choose their language before entering the site
- help non-English speakers feel more comfortable and capable of navigating the website upon entering

**1. Dashboard Home Page and Simplified Navigation Menu** 
- reduces the amount of links and information on the main navigation menu of the website to make important functions, like finding EBT account balance and action items, easy to find
- makes the interface less cluttered and more minimalistic
  
  
**2. "Action Required" Pop-up Notification** 
- lets users know when a mandatory action is needed for their account as soon as they log-in
- a streamlined way for users to complete those actions by adding a button that links them straight to the next step


**4. Simplified Online Application Process**
- a visible button on the Home Page that leads to the Benefit Application Process

***Tasks***
1. Choose language before entering the website.
2. Be notified of a mandatory action required, such as a mandatory document submission, then complete the action right away.
3. Check your EBT Account Balance and Monthly Deposits.
4. Start and complete an application for benefits.
5. Chat with a DPSS bot to ask questions.

#### **Purpose**

The purpose of this low-fidelity prototype is to illustrate the re-imagined design of the YBN website by showcasing the flow of the tasks mentioned above.  

### Wireframes and Wireflow

### Prototype Testing

To test the functionality of my prototype, I asked a friend to complete a few tasks for me. To view the entire low-fidelity prototype and testing, click [here](https://freehand.invisionapp.com/freehand/document/LxEpXdxfI).

***Task 1 (all colors):*** Choose a language and sign in.

***Task 2 (purple):*** Be notified of a mandatory action required, such as a mandatory document submission, then complete the action right away.

***Task 3 (blue):*** Check your EBT Account Balance and Monthly Deposits.

***Task 4 (orange):*** Start and complete an application for benefits.

### Areas of Confusion

The user was able to complete all tasks but was a bit confused when navigating the prototype and all the arrows present. In the screenshot below, while working on task 2 in purple, the user went straight to the dashboard wireframe and missed the wireframe with the "Action Required" pop-up window. As a result, the user attempted to complete the task from the dashboard, which is doable, but my prototype intended to test the pop-up window. Also, I did not draw an arrow from the dashboard wireframe to the "Submit document" wireframe, so the user went to a different wireframe below that did not take them to the document submission and was confused when they did not see it. The user then realized that they were in the wrong place and went back to the previous frame, then proceeded to complete the task and visit the correct wireframes.

In the screenshot below, while working on Task 4 in orange, the user was confused by the blue text next to the "Upload a file" button" that says "What kind of document should I upload?" This text was meant to be a link that would create a small pop-up window telling users what kind of document would be accepted to verify rent amount shown in the next wireframe below, but since the user had not reached that wireframe yet, they did not understand why the text was there. Additionally, the user commented that there was no window or "check" to verify that the uploaded document was what it was intended to be, like the document submission task had.

## Reflection

From this low-fidelity prototype creation and testing process, I learned that the steps to complete a task have to be very specific and detailed yet simple to figure out, which turned out to be more challenging than I expected. It was challenging to think of every button, word, link, etc. that should or should not be present on the screen in order to make the task as simple as possible, and then also create an aesthetically pleasing, minimal design.

Overall, I think the prototyping process went pretty well. My prototype tester was able to complete all tasks with minimal interruptions. Next time, I think it might be helpful to create separate documents for each task rather than add them all on one document with different colors. This might minimize the number of arrows and colors on the page and prevent the test user from becoming overwhelmed with lots of arrows and colors. In terms of the actual prototype design, based on the test user's feedback, I might add a small "information" icon next to the "What kind of document should I upload?" link to indicate to the user that it is a clickable link for more information. I will also create a pop-up window when uploading documents during the application process, similar to the pop-up window when submitting something during the general document submission process, reviewing the uploaded documents to make sure they're correct.
