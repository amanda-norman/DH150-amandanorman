# Assignment 06: Low-Fidelity Prototype
## Amanda Norman, DH 150 Spring 2020
### **Description** 
My project is a redesign of the YourBenefitsNow (YBN) website - a self-service portal from the Los Angeles Department of Public Social Services that allows users to view information and complete tasks related to their government benefits. 

**Personas**

After conducting user research, I creating the following personas of typical users: 

1. Working college students who need a quick and efficient way to access information about their benefits online
2. Low-income families and parents who have low technical literacy and need an interface that is simple to navigate and streamlines the process of applying for benefits and checking the status of benefits.

**Features and Tasks**

Based on my user research and personas, I created several features and potential tasks that would meet the personas' needs:

**1. Choice of Language Prompt**
- prompts users to choose their language before entering the site
- help non-English speakers feel more comfortable and capable of navigating the website upon entering

**1. Dashboard Home Page and Simplified Navigation Menu** 
- reduces the amount of links and information on the main navigation menu of the website to make important functions, like finding EBT account balance and action items, easy to find
- makes the interface less cluttered and more minimalistic

**2. "Action Required" Pop-up Notification** 
- lets users know when a mandatory action is needed for their account as soon as they log-in
- a streamlined way for users to complete those actions by adding a button that links them straight to the next step

  ***Task***
  
  1. Click on the button that says your preferred language.
  2. Click on the bar next to "username" and type your YBN website username.
  3. Click on the bar next to "password" and type your YBN website password.
  4. Click the button that says "Sign In"
  5. When the "Action Required" window appears, click "Submit Now"
  6. Click "Upload New File" and choose "file1.pdf"
  7. Click the drop-down box below "Document Type" and choose "Income Verification"
  8. Click "Submit"
  9. Click "Yes"


**4. Simplified Online Application Process**
- a visible button on the Home Page that leads to the Benefit Application Process
-

**Purpose**

The purpose of this low-fidelity prototype is to illustrate the re-imagined design of the YBN website by showcasing the flow of the tasks mentioned above.
