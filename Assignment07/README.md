# Assignment 07: High-Fidelity Prototype
## Amanda Norman, DH 150 Spring 2020

The project is a redesign of the YourBenefitsNow website, an online self-service portal from the Los Angeles Department of Public Social Services that allows users to check the status of and complete tasks related to their government benefits. The purpose of this prototyping stage is to create a high-fidelity mockup of the graphical user interface and the user flow of the product that incorporates improved design features. In creating this prototype, the designer(s) is able to visually construct their idea and create the flow of the product in order to experiment with design features and functionality.  

The process began with conducting user research about their experience with the original website and its functionality, as well as any pain points. Then, user personas (as seen below) were created to envision typical users of the product, as well as their needs and motivations. Depending on these needs and motivations, each persona had a different scenario that influenced the various tasks that the prototype would support.

## Tasks 
This prototype supports the following tasks:

**1. Choose your language***
* Users can choose their language before entering the site

   ****This prototype only supports the English language***

**2. Submitting Documents via "Action Required" Notification**
* When a document submission is needed, a notification alerts the user as soon as they log in and contains a button linking them directly to the document submission page
* Users can access the page to submit documents via a button on the home page and via the navigation bar
* Users can upload a file and choose what type of document it is before submitting

**3. Access EBT Account Balance and Monthly Deposit information**
* Users can see their account information including case number, case status, EBT Account Balance, etc. on the home page/dashboard
* Users can also use the button on the home screen and the navigation menu to access Benefit Information like EBT Account Balance and Monthly Deposits 

**4. Apply for Benefits**
* Users can apply for benefits by clicking the button on the home page/dashboard
* Users can apply for benefits by using the navigation menu
* Users can save their application progress as they complete the application

## Screen Designs

After conducting user research and creating user personas, I learned that, overall, users value a simple and easy-to-understand interface design that looks modern. For example, one change I made to simplify the previous website to clean up the interface and make the website less overwhelming is the separate page/button for Help & Resources, which were originally on side panels static throughout all pages of the site. I also wanted the most important information, like account balances and action items, to be present on the homepage so users could quickly and easily access this frequently-needed information without navigating to other pages.

Since this is a government website, I wanted the font choice to be legible and professional, yet modern and unintimidating, so I chose Helvetica Neue. Unlike more traditional fonts like Arial and Times New Roman, this font is a bit more modern and inviting without risking legibility and professionalism.

For the color scheme, I used Adobe Colors to find color palettes that were gender-neutral and compliant with accessibility standards, since users would be anyone who receives government assistance and therefore would encompass a large range of ages, genders, abilities, etc.

I used the Adobe XD plug-in, Stark, to check the contrast of my prototype and ensure the colors and font styles I used would be compliant with WCAG2.0 AA Accessibility standards.

## Impression Test
I conducted an impression test to gauge whether or not users understood what the website would be used for and to gain insight on initial thoughts of the website.

From this impression test, I learned that the user was able to understand the basic purpose and functions of the website, including the actions that users would be able to do. This user thought the website was simple, easy to understand and presented the important information that users would need to know in a clear way.

## Cognitive Walkthrough
Through this cognitive walkthrough, I found that the user was able to successfully complete all tasks without running into any issues. There was nothing that was confusing to this user and she was able to cancel or back-flow successfully. The user expressed that she thought the design features, like the buttons, were clearly labeled and easy to understand. She also mentioned that she liked how the website reviewed userâ€™s actions before submitting, like the document submission and the application, so that users could double-check their information, prevent mistakes and ensure everything is accurate.

## Peer Review Feedback and Iterations
**1. Colors**
One main piece of feedback I received was that I might want to adjust my color scheme to be a bit more harmonious. In my initial prototype version, I did not use a tool like Adobe Color, but I chose colors based on what I liked. This was helpful feedback to realize I should be a bit more strategic about the visual design and colors of the prototype, and led me to using Adobe Color.

**2. Background Image & Foreground Content**
I also received feedback on perhaps providing more depth to the website design to make the content easier for users to look at. I did this by adding a subtle background image and adding a white center panel that would display all the content, rather than making the entire page white. This idea definitely improved the visual design of my website by adding more dimension and creating a more narrow foreground that would allow users to focus on a smaller area of the screen.

## Reflection
Throughout the process of creating my mock-up and the interactive user flow of the prototype, I more thoroughly understood the importance of user research and user personas. Throughout the prototyping process, I frequently thought back to the insights I gathered and the personas I created to ensure I was designing for those users, not just myself. I tried to make the prototype as detailed as possible while maintaining simplicity, and after the impression test and cognitive walkthrough, I believe I was able to achieve that. The entire process was a bit more time-consuming than I expected, but definitely worth it to create a functional, visually appealing product. 

If I could do something differently about my process, I would ask an older or less technically literate person to perform the impression test or cognitive walkthrough. I received mostly positive feedback from these two exercises, but the two participants were both young and fairly technically literate. A person who is not as comfortable with using web interfaces might have helpful feedback I could incorporate into future iterations of my design.
